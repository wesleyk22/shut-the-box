# Shut the box

JavaFX project that closely simulates the game "Shut the box" 

## Description

This project is a JavaFX project that I made in a community college data structures class. Here
is a video explaining the rules of the game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5J4O2BSy85I

## What I personally learned from building this project

This project mainly allowed me to get better at using JavaFX, and also Object Oriented Programming techniques. In JavaFX,
a lot of things can be converted into Objects, including UI elements themselves. And so in this project I created
an elegant inheritance hierachy of Objects. I also learned how to implement a Model-view-controller pattern in java,
making the controller handle the communicate between the model and the view. 

### How to run the program

For this project, I just run it in BlueJ. I'm not sure how to run JavaFX projects any other way at the time of this writing. But you
open the project in BlueJ, and right click "ShutTheBoxMain" and click "Run JavaFX application"
